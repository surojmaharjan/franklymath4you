               <strong style="color:#F35723;">Flexibility in scheduling </strong>
                  <p> Today’s students are extremely busy.  They go to activities after school and often do not get home until 8 or 9 pm.  It can be very difficult to find a weekly time for a tutor.  With this service, <span>no appointment is needed</span>.  A student can email their questions whenever and wherever they are whether they are on the bus on the way to fencing practice or at school working on their homework during a free period. </p>
                  <strong style="color:#F35723;">Answers when students need it</strong>
                  <p>Unfortunately the timing of when students need help with assignments is not always on the day they have their weekly appointment with a tutor.  Often a 
                     student will meet with a tutor on Tuesday but then come across a homework question on Wednesday that they do not understand, only to learn that they will be having a quiz on that topic the following Tuesday before seeing their tutor again.  With this service, students have access to help 7 days a week.</p>
                  <strong style="color:#F35723;">Less expensive </strong>
                  <p>Because I can avoid travel time and am able to help multiple students in an hour electronically, I can offer this service for a <span>fraction of what it would cost to hire me in person once a week</span>.  Depending on the package you choose, you also have access to personalized practice exams, which can be sent back to me for scoring. Additionally, rather than having access to me for one hour once a week, the student can contact me whenever they have questions. </p>
                  <strong style="color:#F35723;">Step by step written and verbal explanations</strong>
                  <p>Whenever I answer a homework question, I will send either a written solution explaining what I did every step of the way or in some cases a video of me solving the problem on paper and explaining what I am doing each step of the way.  Therefore students can look back at these explanations and use them as models for solving similar questions.</p>
                  <strong style="color:#F35723;">Personalized practice exams based on what is going on in the students class</strong>
                  <p>While there are thousands of math practice books for sale, it is often difficult if not impossible to find one that matches the specific curriculum in your child’s school.  And even if you are able to find one where the topics match up, it may not use the same method to solve a problem that is being taught in your child’s classroom.  This often means having to purchase a variety of different math practice books and try to compile problems from each of them.  With this service, your child can get a true practice exam from one place.</p>
                  <strong style="color:#F35723;">Times have changed</strong>
                  <p>Math is taught differently now than it was when most of my student’s parents were in school. Even those parents who were and still are excellent math 
                     students, often have difficulty following the methods being taught in classrooms today.  This service eliminates any need for argument or disagreement when your child tells you that you are doing it wrong.  While you are likely not wrong, it may not help your child on a test to know the method you learned as a child if it is different than the one their teacher wants to see.</p>
                  <strong style="color:#F35723;">You know your tutor</strong>
                  <p>There are plenty of online tutoring services on the web.  If you google anything related to “math tutor” dozens of sites show up giving you thousands of tutors from all over the world to book for 15 to 60 minute online tutoring sessions.  Frankly Math is not trying to compete with these sites.  This site was created because I was getting many more calls asking for tutoring than there were hours in the day.  When using this site you are essentially booking me just as if we were setting up a one-hour weekly session.  This is my way of reaching as many students as I can.
